      <h2>Challenge 3: Create a Form</h2>
      <form>
        <label for="fname">First Name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last Name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br>
        <label for="mname">Middle Name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="mname" name="fname"><br>
      </form>

      <h2>Challenge 5: Accessibility Concerns</h2>
      <p>Some accessibility concerns I discovered after completing these challeges is that in challenge 1,
        the viewer might get confused because there is no option to go to assignment 2 which is the index.html page they are already on.
        I could address this by including a link to assignment 2 that would just stay on the page they're on. Another accessibility concern
        for challenge 3, forms, could be that the form doesn't do anything once filled out. I would address this by having an output appear when they fill in the form. </p>
